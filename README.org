#+title: Library for working with CoNLL-U files with CL

The =cl-conllu= is a Common Lisp library to work with [[http://universaldependencies.org/format.html][CoNLL-U]],
licensed under the [[http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0][Apache license]].

It is developed and tested with SBCL but should probably run with any
other implementation.

* Install

The =cl-conllu= library is now available from quicklisp distribution,
if you are not planning to change the code, just use:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(ql:quickload :cl-conllu)
#+END_SRC

If you don't have quicklisp installed already, follow [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/#installation][these steps]].

If you plan on contributing, clone this project to your
=local-projects= quicklisp directory (usually at
=~/quicklisp/local-projects/=) and use the same command as above to
load the code.
